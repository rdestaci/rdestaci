## Hi there, I'm Reeka! ðŸ‘‹

I am an M.S. student in Computational Social Science at UC San Diego, passionate about diversifying voices in NLP technologies.

### About Me

I am from San Diego, California, born and raised in Chula Vista. I have a B.S. in Cognitive Science (with specialization in Language and Culture) and a B.A. in Linguistics (with specialization in Cognition and Language). In my free time I enjoy junk journaling, baking bread, and watching live jazz.

I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge in **natural language processing (NLP)**, **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**, **text-to-speech (TTS)**, and **LLMs**. I am deeply motivated by the potential of NLP technology in supporting individuals with learning differences, including ASD, ADHD, and dyslexia.

### I am currently working on...
  
- Applying low-resource computational methods to advance diversity in automatic speech recognition (ASR) models.

- Exploring neural network-based techniques to enhance cutting-edge text-to-speech (TTS) technology.
