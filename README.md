## Hi there, I'm Reeka! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an M.S. student in Computational Social Science at UC San Diego, interested in diversifying voices in NLP technologies.

I am currently working on:

- Using large language models to glean insights as to how humans process language
  
- Exploring methods to improve variability in automatic speech recognition models
